# A LaTeX template for listing seminar programmes

Make sure to have installed a reasonably modern distribution of
[texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), then edit `programme.tex` and
simply type `make` to build the corresponding PDF. For an example see
the programme from [SPLS June
2019](https://github.com/spls-series/spls-series.github.io/blob/master/meetings/2019/june/static/programme.pdf).
